# A3 3d Math

Assignment No 3 for the computer graphics course. 

After reading the files 'cghomogen.pdf' and 'Fundamentals-of-Computer-Graphics-Transformations-Viewing.pdf', create your own version of the gl-matrix library. 

Particularly, implement the mat4 and vec3 classes, and all the methods needed for the mat4 class to be used instead of the gl-matrix library.

Test your library in the previous assignment (A2 3d Figures).

**Rubric:**

1. mat4 class has, at least, the following methods:
    1. create
    2. perspective
    3. translate
    4. rotate
2. mat4 methods behave as expected.
3. vec3 has the attributes and methods needed to work with the mat4 class.
4. Tested the library in A2 3d Figures.
5. Uploaded the library and the modified assignment.
