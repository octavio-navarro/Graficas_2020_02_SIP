# A4 Sun shader

Assignment No 4 for the computer graphics course. 

Review the shader material examples and develop your own shader material to simulate a sun. A similar example would be the one shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHEgO6JfCrs).

Particularly, consider at least two textures that are combined with a certain opacity, and add motion to the textures through a simple animation.

Apply the shader material to a sphere geometry.

**Rubric:**

1. Created a custom shader.
2. The shader loads at least two textures.
3. The shader calculates an alpha and new colors based on the textures.
4. Used a *time* variable to add animations to the textures.
